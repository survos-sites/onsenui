# OnsenUI Symfony App

Testing  https://onsen.io/ on Symfony

Although OnsenIO appears to be no longer maintained, it's got such a nice navigation system that I want to see how well it works.

Unfortunately, it won't work with Symfony's AssetMapper, as the es6 support is weak.  But it can be installed with a CDN.
